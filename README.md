Hey Kevin, 
The basic skeleton of the website is there. We just need you to put in some fluff and a bootstrap menu.


This is the way we were thinking about setting up the bootstrap menu. You'll only have two links on it:
1) Beans (which takes you to index.html)
2) Featured Beans (which takes you to featuredRecipes.html)

The other three pages (recipe1, recipe2, and recipe3) will be linked through featuredRecipes.html
featuredRecipes.html will need some help with making it look good. Whatever you think is best.

For the style, we are loosely following this website:
https://www.allrecipes.com/





Our bean themed recipes:
