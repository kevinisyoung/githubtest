Hey Kevin, 
This is the way we were thinking about setting up the bootstrap menu. You'll only have two links on it:
1) Beans (which takes you to index.html)
2) Featured Beans (which takes you to featuredRecipes.html)

The other three pages (recipe1, recipe2, and recipe3) will be linked through featuredRecipes.html
########################









For the style, we are loosely following this website:
https://www.allrecipes.com/





Our bean themed recipes:
