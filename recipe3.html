        <h3>Steps for preparation:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter in a medium non-stick skillet over medium high heat until melted. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes. Add beans, ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and water. Stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>

            <li>While beans cook, heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add eggs, season with salt and pepper, and cook until whites are set but yolks are still runny. Divide toast between 4 plates, the top with beans (or place on the side) then top beans with eggs.</li>
            
        </ol>
